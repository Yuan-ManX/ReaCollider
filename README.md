# ReaCollider

Use Reaper from SuperCollider. 

Currently this package includes ways to generate projects for Reaper and an interface for the reaper-commandline tools, allowing among other things batch conversion of sound files from within SuperCollider using Reaper's fxchains.

## Installation

From within SuperCollider:

```supercollider
Quarks.install("https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/ReaCollider")
```
